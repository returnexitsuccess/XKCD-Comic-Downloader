XKCD-Comic-Downloader
=====================

Downloads and updates image files for every XKCD comic along with titles, transcripts, and alt-text.
Version 1 parses the html file on each webpage to download the comic and the text. Version 2 uses the JSON info for each comic instead. Dates on files suggest this took me almost two years to find T_T

I can't speak for the current reliability of version 1, but version 2 has reliably downloaded every comic to date (12/29/14) which is currently comic #1466. This will account for problems with abnormal comics such as #404, large image comics, and scrollable comics.

Must specify a directory in the .py file before using.
